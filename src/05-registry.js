     5. TOOLS — ⭐ the plugin registry

        No tool ever names another tool. When one needs something another
        provides it asks the registry a question with no id in it.

        Every tool declares what it IS. The kind decides which of the two
        exclusive hooks it owns, and audit.js checks the declaration against
        the hooks the file actually implements:
          'instrument'  describes the element under the cursor
          'rule'        judges an element → audit(info)
          'lens'        decorates the numbers other tools print → annotate()

        Hooks, all optional, all invoked as hook.call(tool, …):
          badge(info)    → HTML string for the full badge
          compact(info)  → HTML string for the compact badge
          report(info)   → array of report lines
          reportTail()   → array of summary lines, after every pin block
          draw(ctx)      → custom drawing; ctx = { layer, Place, State, U }
          listRows()     → panel list rows { tag, label, detail, pins }
          pendingIndex() → index into State.pins of a pin still being chosen
          annotate(html, n, info) → 'lens': wrap one number's html
          audit(info)    → 'rule': [{ el, severity, rule, message, key }]
          css            → stylesheet text, read from EVERY registered tool

     * WHY THIS EXISTS: measure used to ask whether one specific NAMED tool was
     * switched on before it printed a padding, which made this file's claim
     * that tools are independent a lie. It asks this instead — "how does a
     * number want decorating here?" — and neither side learns the other's id,
     * because the only thing that knows both of them is the registry.
     *
     * Returns null when no lens is on, which is what keeps undecorated output
     * byte-for-byte what it was. Lenses fold in registry order (= filename
     * order), each one wrapping the previous one's html.
