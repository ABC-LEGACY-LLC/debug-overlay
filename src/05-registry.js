     5. TOOLS — ⭐ the plugin registry

        No tool ever names another tool. When one needs something another
        provides it asks the registry a question with no id in it.

        A tool declares nothing about what it IS. What it can do is the set of
        hooks it implements, and that is what everything dispatches on — a
        label would only repeat it, and could go stale against it.

        Roles are not exclusive. A tool may decorate other tools' numbers AND
        produce findings; grid does both.

        Hooks, all optional, all invoked as hook.call(tool, …):
          badge(info)    → HTML string for the full badge
          compact(info)  → HTML string for the compact badge
          report(info)   → array of report lines
          reportTail()   → array of summary lines, after every pin block
          draw(ctx)      → custom drawing; ctx = { layer, Place, State, U }
          listRows()     → panel list rows { tag, label, detail, pins }
          pendingIndex() → index into State.pins of a pin still being chosen
          annotate(html, n, info) → 'lens': wrap one number's html
          audit(info)    → 'rule': [{ el, severity, rule, message, key }]
          options()      → [{ key, label, values, def }] the panel can change
          css            → stylesheet text, read from EVERY registered tool

     * the other does not, and nothing said so.
